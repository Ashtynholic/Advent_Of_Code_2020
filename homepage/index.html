<!-- Implement in your homepage directory a website that must:

1.Contain at least four different .html pages, at least one of which is index.html (the main page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.

2.Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>. Using some tag (e.g., <p>) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!

3.Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. See Bootstrap’s documentation to get started. In particular, you might find some of Bootstrap’s components of interest. To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-TX8t27EcRE3e/ihU7zmQxVncDAy5uIKz4rEkgIXeMed4M0jlfIDPvg6uqKI2xXr2" crossorigin="anonymous">
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ho+j7jyWK8fNQe+A12Hb8AhRq26LrZ/JpcUGGOn+Y7RsweNrtN/tE3MoK7ZeZDyx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
in your pages’ <head>, below which you can also include
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
to link your own CSS.

4.Have at least one stylesheet file of your own creation, styles.css, which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors (e.g. tag (example), class (.example), or ID (#example)), and within which you use a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as font-size, or margin; and

5.Integrate one or more features of JavaScript into your site to make your site more interactive. For example, you can use JavaScript to add alerts, to have an effect at a recurring interval, or to add interactivity to buttons, dropdowns, or forms. Feel free to be creative!

6.Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.

7.You should also create a text file, specification.txt, which lists the 10 HTML tags and 5 CSS properties you’ve used, as well as a brief (one-sentence) description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap. -->

          <div>
          <p>Hi there! My name is Ashton Hollick, and I'm a student currently taking CS50 through Harvard Online. Im 37, a mother of two incredible boys (Billy, 10 years old, and Bobby, 3 years old). I've been married for over 18 years, and still going strong. I've been a musician and entertainer since I was 16 years old! I've opened up for bands like Candlebox, Queensryche, Stryper, and more! I grew up with a father that worked in tech fields, but both of my parents were musicians and taught me instruments and music theory together. At one point, I played in a band with my mother and sister, kinda like 'The Partridge Family' meets 'The Osbournes'.</p>
